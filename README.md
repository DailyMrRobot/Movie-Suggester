Movie Suggester Documentation:

Hello, If you are reading this it means that you, yes YOU, have chosen to download my copy of a movie suggester. Now I know what you might be thinking. “How do I understand your project?” Well fret not as I am getting around to explaining this. 

  Overview
So first what needs to be understood with this project is that as of right now it is just off a set list of movies that I took the time to scrape and add into the program, so that means there might be a chance there's a movie or two in there that are missing, if there is a movie that you would like added or if there are any issues you run into with the program. Feel free to reach out to me at moviesuggester78@gmail.com.

How does it work?
So how the program itself works is that you get asked about a specific genre and your age(So this way that no inappropriate movies get recommended if you're under the age of 18). However The genres I have noted on the file are Action, adventure, sci-fi,drama, biography,drama,horror,musical and I believe Comedy. So If you’re trying to find Frozen, You would say the genre is Musical and then you would enter in your age. So if you have it listed as a family movie, I would say you need to re enter it as a musical. This will be something that gets updated at a later point in time to reflect that Frozen(and others) is also a family movie as well.

The genre classification might need to be updated to reflect that movies have two categories(Comedy/Family,Action/Adventure, etc)


				Future Updates
Enhanced Movie Classification: The movie classification system will be updated to reflect multiple categories which by proxy will ensure more accurate recommendations
Movie Database Expansion: Additional movies will be added into the database which would allow for a wider selection of movies for users.
Graphical Interface Updates: The graphical interface may get a slight update based on the initial feedback. Ultimately this will be prioritized on user input.
TV Show Integration: As of right now there may be plans to expand this application to include TV Show suggestions that would offer users a broader range of entertainment options. This is something that will be reviewed at a later date.
Github Updates: Any and all new updates will be pushed out to my github repository which I will link for easy access.
